Tasked with making a HTML/JS game for users to play during the downtime/maintenence of the site, my group decided to create a Flappy Bird game, due to its simple & addictive nature.

I did all of the art and UI for the project, along with doing some of the major functions of the core game such as: Start screen, Scaling the game for mobile (making sure pipes are right distance, gaps are makable, the "bird" spawns in the right place, boundries) & more.

Along with other smaller features to bring the game together such as: scrolling ground to make the pipes appear to be stuck to the floor, and not the bird being stuck in place. I also had input on the scoring algorithm (a work around was needed due to scaling and the framework's limitations).

Achieved a First (75%) for this project.
